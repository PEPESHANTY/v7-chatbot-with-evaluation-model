    "question": "What are the three types of male sterile lines mentioned in the definition of hybrid rice parental seed, and what are their genetic characteristics?",
    "ground_truth": "The three types of male sterile lines are: 1) Cytoplasmic Male Sterility (CMS) - genetically determined by cytoplasm, 2) Thermo-sensitive Genetic Male Sterility (TGMS) - nuclear genetic male sterility sensitive to temperature, and 3) Photoperiodic sensitive Genetic Male Sterility (PGMS) - nuclear genetic male sterility sensitive to day length.",

    "question": "What is the key difference between three-line and two-line hybrid rice systems in terms of parental lines used?",
    "ground_truth": "The three-line system uses a cytoplasmic male sterile line (CMS line A) maintained by a corresponding maintainer line (line B) and crossed with a fertility restorer line (line R). The two-line system uses an environmental-sensitive genetic male sterile line (EGMS) crossed with a fertile paternal line (line P), without requiring a maintainer line.",

    "question": "What measures can be taken to adjust the flowering time mismatch between the male and female lines in hybrid rice production, and what are the specific details for using water as an adjustment method?",
    "ground_truth": "To adjust the flowering time mismatch, water can be used by draining the field to slow down the male line if it develops earlier or maintaining a water depth of 15 cm to 20 cm to speed up the male line if it develops later than the female line.",

    "question": "What are the three main groups of weeds found in rice fields, and what specific management practices are recommended to control them?",
    "ground_truth": "The three main groups of weeds in rice fields are broadleaf weeds, sedges, and grasses. Recommended management practices include using certified rice seeds, thorough soil preparation and leveling, row seeding or machine transplanting, early water application to suppress weeds, hand weeding during 15-18 days after sowing, cutting remaining weed panicles to prevent seed dispersal, preventing weed seed formation on field edges and irrigation channels, and using pre-emergence herbicides like Pretilachor or Butachlor and post-emergence herbicides like Pyrazosulfuron Ethyl or Cyhalofop-butyl.",

    "ground_truth": "Golden apple snails thrive in environments with host plants like duckweed or water hyacinth, excessive nitrogen fertilization, and continuously flooded fields. Integrated management strategies include releasing ducks into fields, manual collection of snails and eggs during land preparation, creating trenches with attractant plants like papaya or cassava leaves, placing stakes to collect egg masses, installing 5mm mesh nets in water channels to block snail entry, and using molluscicides containing Metaldehyde, Niclosamide, or Saponin.",

    "ground_truth": "Rice Grassy Stunt Virus (RGSV) causes symptoms such as stunted growth, multiple tillers, normal root system, short and narrow leaves that are green-yellow or yellow-orange, and young leaves with rust-colored or red-yellow spots. In contrast, Rice Ragged Stunt Virus (RRSV) leads to stunted plants with dark green leaves, ragged and wavy leaf edges, bumps along the veins, deformed and curled leaf tips, and panicles that fail to emerge properly, resulting in empty grains.",
