    "ground_truth": "We established a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay using the unique sequences of VL1 as target sequences for the rapid and simple detection of pathogenic M. indicum strains. Our initial evaluation demonstrated that the LAMP assay successfully distinguished between pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains infecting rice plants in a rapid and sensitive manner.",
