    "ground_truth": "The in silico DDH values between strain VL1 and M. indicum strains SE2.11T and SE3.6 were 86.0%, which is higher than the 70% DDH threshold for prokaryotic species delineation. The ANI values for VL1 versus SE2.11T and SE3.6 were 98.19% and 98.18%, respectively, both higher than the 95% ANI threshold for species delineation.",
